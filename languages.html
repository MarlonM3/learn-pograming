<h1>How many languages are out There</h1>
<h2>250 - 9,000</h2>
<p>The exact number of coding languages is uncertain, as different sources have different criteria and methods for counting them123. However, some estimates range from 250 to 9,000, with only a few dozen being widely used124. Coding languages are designed for different purposes, platforms, and styles, and can be classified into four main types: imperative, functional, logical, and object-oriented45.</p>
<h2>Statically Typed Languages</h2>
    <p>Static languages are more strict in catching errors through type checking and it takes more code to build a prototype. Apps built with statically typed languages are more robust, scalable, stable, and easy to maintain. 5 of our easiest programming languages for beginners are statically typed and they are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Objective-C (For iOS development)</li>
    <li>C & C++</li>
    <li>c#</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>Swift (For iOS development)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dynamic Languages</h3>
<p>Dynamic languages are generally easier for total beginners to learn because of their flexibility, where programmers can quickly build an app from scratch with lesser coding. New programmers find them fun to learn because they are very high-level languages, you spend lesser time getting the details right and more time in learning programming concepts. 4 of our best programming languages list for beginners are dynamic languages and they are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>JavaScript<li>
    <li>PHP</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Ruby</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
</ul>
