    <h1>how i learned</h1>
    <p>The reason why i made this was because i knew python and barely any html and none css so i couldnt make the website look good. Also because i barely know any html i am happy with my website<br /></p>
    <p>Also i can here to get experience and not prizes and i got experience on how to build a webwsite from scratch without any prior experience so i am happy.</p>
    <h2>Why i created this website</h2>
    <p>the reason i created this website was because when i first started there was manhy courses that were either good but cost money or just cost money and i didnt really know where to start to i learned c and that was hard so i made this so the people that have no experience could know where to start</p>
